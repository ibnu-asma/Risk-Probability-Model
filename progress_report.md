# Project Foundation and Initial Analysis: A Credit Risk Model Progress Report

**Date:** June 28, 2025

## Introduction

This report outlines the initial progress on the B5W5 Credit Risk Probability Model project. The foundational phase, covering project setup, business context understanding (Task 1), and initial data exploration (Task 2), has been successfully completed. This document serves as a verification of our understanding and a summary of the work performed.

## Project Foundation: Setup and Verification

The project structure has been established according to best practices for a machine learning project. Key directories for data (`data/`), source code (`src/`), notebooks (`notebooks/`), and tests (`tests/`) are in place. 

The project's dependencies have been reviewed from the `requirements.txt` file. The selection of libraries such as `pandas` for data manipulation, `scikit-learn` for model building, `fastapi` for API deployment, and `mlflow` for experiment tracking, confirms that the technical foundation is well-suited for developing and deploying a robust credit risk model.

## Task 1: Understanding the Business Context

A thorough review of the business problem has been completed, with the key findings documented in the `README.md` file. Our understanding is as follows:

*   **Regulatory Influence:** The project operates within a context heavily influenced by financial regulations like **Basel II**. This places a strong emphasis on model interpretability. Financial institutions must be able to explain their credit risk models to regulators, making transparent models like **Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence (WoE)** a preferred choice over more complex "black-box" alternatives.

*   **The Proxy Variable Challenge:** The dataset lacks a direct "default" label, which is a common challenge when working with alternative data. To overcome this, we will need to engineer a **proxy target variable** to represent credit risk. This report acknowledges the inherent business risks of this approach: a poorly chosen proxy could lead to a model that is not aligned with the true definition of default, potentially resulting in inaccurate lending decisions.

*   **The Interpretability vs. Accuracy Trade-off:** A central theme of this project is the trade-off between the high interpretability of models like Logistic Regression and the potentially higher predictive accuracy of models like **Gradient Boosting**. Our initial analysis recognizes that while Gradient Boosting might capture more complex patterns, its lack of transparency is a significant hurdle in a regulated financial setting. The `README.md` now includes a detailed discussion of this trade-off, supported by external references.

## Task 2: Initial Data Exploration

With the business context established, the initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) has been performed. The `data/raw/data.csv` file has been loaded, and an EDA notebook has been created at `notebooks/1.0-eda.ipynb`.

The notebook contains a systematic analysis of the dataset, including:

1.  **Data Loading and Structure Analysis:** Loading the dataset and examining its basic properties (number of rows, columns, and data types).
2.  **Summary Statistics:** Generating descriptive statistics for all numerical columns to understand their scale and distribution.
3.  **Feature Distributions:** Visualizing the distributions of both numerical (histograms) and categorical (bar plots) features to identify skewness, and common values.
4.  **Correlation Analysis:** Creating a heatmap to visualize the correlation between numerical features, which helps in identifying potential multicollinearity.
5.  **Missing Value and Outlier Detection:** Identifying columns with missing values and using box plots to detect potential outliers in numerical features.

This initial EDA provides a solid understanding of the dataset's characteristics and will inform the feature engineering and modeling steps that follow.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

The project foundation is solid. The business context is well-understood, and the initial data exploration has been completed. The project is now ready to proceed to **Task 3: Feature Engineering**, where we will begin the process of transforming the raw data into meaningful features for our credit risk model.
